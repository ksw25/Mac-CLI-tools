# Mac-CLI-tools (My favorite cli tools)

1. [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) — It is a really cool text editor that provides syntax highlighting and more (otherwise we recommend Vim as an alternative). `curl https://getmic.ro | bash`
2. [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) — A directory / file explorer providing an easier way to find files via the terminal — sort of like Windows Explorer for the console. `pip install ranger-fm`
3. [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#installation) — a Linux “cat” command alternative, provides syntax highlighting and enumeration in a clean, efficient interface — we love this, and think you would too. `brew install bat`
4. [Lnav](https://github.com/tstack/lnav) — As discussed above, a tool to explore and decipher all of those pesky cryptic log files you need to review in order to troubleshoot an issue. `brew install lnav`
5. [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/http-method) — A curl-like tool to interact with HTTP servers — For those who use or interact with web servers. `brew install httpie`
